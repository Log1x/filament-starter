- 🔨 GitHub Actions workflows for [Pint](https://github.com/laravel/pint) with pre-configured Dependabot for dependencies.

## Requirements

Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

- [PHP](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/install.php) >= 8.2
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 18

## Getting Started

Start by creating the project using Composer and configuring the `.env` file:

```sh
composer create-project log1x/filament-starter:dev-main
cd filament-starter
```

After `.env` is configured, you can proceed to migrate & seed the database:

```sh
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

Once the database is seeded, you can login at `/admin` using the default admin user:

```yaml
Username: admin
Password: admin
```

### Build Assets

The project assets are compiled using Vite. This can be done by installing the dependencies and running the build command with npm.

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

## Plugins Used

The following [Filament plugins](https://filamentphp.com/plugins) come fully implemented and configured out of the box:
